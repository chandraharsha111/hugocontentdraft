# General points

  - Cheap stocks can become cheaper and stocks that have been increasing in price can increase too
  - Wall street makes money on activity, you make your money on inactivity 
  - Never buy stocks with money you need in 5Yrs.You don’t want to be forced to selling stocks to raise cash 
  - Don't blindly follow wall street professionals (they can be wrong, cant know of their portfolio changes right away)
  - Investing is an art, not science 
  - Ways companies can increase earnings: Reducing costs, raise prices, expand into new markets, sell more
  - If you know why you bought a stock in first place, you will be able to know when to sell it


# One up of WallStreet

- Three ways to invest in a trend:
   - *Off shoot of old picks*: During gold rush, people selling shovels, tents etc can make profit
   - *Free internet play*: Internet business could be embedded in a non-Internet company with real earnings and stock price 
   - *Tangential benefit*: Brick and motor business could benefit from internet to cut costs, streamline operations, make it efficient and profitable 
- MIRROR TEST 
   - Do I own a house? Do I need the money? Do I have qualities required to be in the stock market?
- Unwary investor passes out of these states (Concern, Complacency, Capitulation)
- Six Categories of stocks:
  - Slow Growers: Utilities, pay decent dividends,  
  - Stalwarts: Berkshire, protection during recessions etc. 
  - Fast Growers: 20-30 percent growth rate + moat 
  - Asset Plays: Patent drugs, oil, land 
  - Cyclicals: Auto’s and Airline – Coming out of a recession is the best time to buy them 
  - Turnarounds: results of bad acquisitions - follow restructuring costs 
- **Favorable attributes**:
   - It sounds dull or boring – relatively lesser competition 
   - It’s a spin off from parent company – Generally spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well prepared to succeed 
   - Institutions don’t own it and analysts don’t follow it 
   - Rumors around 
   - It’s a low growth or no growth industry
   - Its got a Niche (comfortable business position)
   - People will have to keep buying it 
   - Insiders are buying it, It runs efficiently 
   - Company buys back its shares (acquisitions, raising dividends) 
   - If you find a business that can get away with rising prices without loosing customers – terrific investment 
   - 20 percent growth rate at 20 percent PE is better than 10 Percent growth and 10 Percent PE  

 - **UN FAVORABLE STOCKS**:
    - Hottest stock in the hottest industry 
    - Next something 
    - Bad capital allocation (buying acquisitions at wrong prices)
    - Whisper stocks, Be careful of middleman
    - PE levels tend to be low for slow growers, and high for fast growers, Avoid stocks with very high PE’s 
    - Look if management was given free stock – if yes look how long they were with the company 
    - Look at debt in company’s balance sheets - determines if a company can survive a recession 
    - Bank debt – bad (obligated to pay) and funded debt (okay since it gives time to wiggle out) 
    - Dividends – slow grower omits dividends, your money could be stuck
    - Never consider the book value of the company alone since value of raw materials when moving to finished goods can deprecate rapidly (Yellow cotton may not be as worthy as cotton)
    - Inventories in retail is bad, but okay in automobile industry (still not a positive sign to pile inventories)
    - Companies don’t have to have a pension plan, but if they do they need to pay them even if they go bankrupt 
    - Be careful with companies growing 50-100 percent a year 
    - Never water weeds (buy falling knives) or pick flowers (sell fast growers)
